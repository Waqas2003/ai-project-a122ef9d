This is a basic cosmetics website with a home page, products page, product detail page, cart page, and checkout page. The website uses React, React Router, and Bootstrap for styling. The products data is stored in a separate file and can be easily replaced with a real API call. The cart functionality is also implemented using a separate utility file.
